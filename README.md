The task was thrilling to work on, and I learned new things. I was excited at first on getting the webpage running with full functionalities so I did some refacoting and styling later as I worked with philosophy of "first, make it work then make it better". 

## Quick start:



```bash
  npm install --force
  npm start
```

add your google api key in .env file \
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your API key"
